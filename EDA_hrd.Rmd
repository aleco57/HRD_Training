Start with data exploration
Should we split by scores of gis, potentially better models by splitting,
could we potentially split by 0-33 33-42 42+, maybe we could model this better? Check if these group sizes will be even
*Then need to look at which variables potentially need to be transformed - this will improve predicted power
Run elasticnet
Run xgboost
Run this analyses for the continous outcome, then see if you can get better model accuracy by splitting the continuous outcome into the three groups
Extract SHAP plots

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(janitor)
library(dlookr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(SmartEDA)
library(GGally)
library(tidymodels)
library(caret)


clean <- readxl::read_xls("~/Documents/D6_all_training.xls")
clean <- clean_names(clean)
```

Check for missing or duplicate data:

```{r, Missing Data}
cleanP <- subset(clean, select=-c(sample_id, brc_am, hrd_status, pd_l1_thr1, pd_l1_thr2))

#We can categorise patients into those who passed the gis threshold of 42
clean <- clean %>% mutate(gis_score_cat = cut(clean$gis_score, breaks=c(-Inf, 33, 42,Inf),
              labels=c("<33", ">=33, <=42", ">42")))


table(clean$gis_score_cat)
#Slight imbalance of individuals in the middle group


#Change to factor variables
clean[,c(7:9,11:12)] <- lapply(clean[,c(7:9,11:12)] , factor)

#Explore those individuals who have brca mutation but low gis_score
clean %>% filter(brc_am==1 & gis_score <=42)
clean %>% filter(brc_am==1 & gis_score <33)
#There are 4 patients who do not meet the threshold however brca test is positive.

get_dupes(clean)

```

```{r}
cleanP <- subset(clean, select=-c(sample_id, brc_am, hrd_status, pd_l1_thr1, pd_l1_thr2))
#Correlation Coeficent for all gis
cleanP %>% correlate() %>% plot()

#Correlation coefficent for gis split into the three groups
clean %>% group_by(gis_score_cat) %>% correlate() %>% plot()

ExpNumViz(cleanP, target="gis_score")
#Doesn't seem to be much of a linear relationship with cont_gis and any of our variables
ExpCatStat(cleanP, Target="gis_score", Pclass="1", plot=TRUE)
#Chi sqaured statistic does however suggest some degree of "information value for cont_gis and the variables

#Check for normality of our cont variables
cleanP %>% normality()
cleanP %>% plot_normality()
```

Normality plots suggests necrosis%, surface area and pdl1 should be logged to approach normality

First, model the continuous gis outcome with linear regression analyses:
Should also check if the linear regression assumptions hold!!

```{r, Model Continuous Outcome}
#Split data into test and train
set.seed(122)
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(cleanP$gis_score, 
                                  list=F,
                                  p=.8)
Train <- cleanP[ trainIndex,]
Test  <- cleanP[-trainIndex,]

#Linear regression with all continuous variables
mod_lin1 <- train(gis_score ~ ., 
                  data=Train,
                  method = "lm")

summary(mod_lin1)
pred_lin1 <- mod_lin1 %>% predict(Test)
plot(pred_lin1, Test$gis_score)
R2(pred_lin1, Test$gis_score)
RMSE(pred_lin1, Test$gis_score)
#Poor Predictive value


#necrosis, surface_area and pd_l1 could be logged as the normality plots suggested
rec_lin2 <- recipe(gis_score ~ ., data=Train) %>%  step_log(necrosis_percent, surface_area_mm_2, pd_l1_cont_score, offset = 1) 
mod_lin2 <- train(rec_lin2, 
                  data = Train,
                  method = "lm")
summary(mod_lin2)
pred_lin2 <- predict(mod_lin2, Test) 
plot(pred_lin2, Test$gis_score)
R2(pred_lin2, Test$gis_score)
RMSE(pred_lin2, Test$gis_score)
#Model R2 Test 1% better then previous


#Use the three most significant variables from the model keeping onto the pre-processing step
rec_lin3 <- recipe(gis_score ~ age + pd_l1_cont_score + surface_area_mm_2, data=Train) %>%  
  step_log(surface_area_mm_2, pd_l1_cont_score, offset = 1) 
mod_lin3 <- train(rec_lin3, 
                  data = Train,
                  method = "lm")

summary(mod_lin3)
pred_lin3 <- predict(mod_lin3, Test) 
plot(pred_lin3, Test$gis_score)
R2(pred_lin3, Test$gis_score)
RMSE(pred_lin3, Test$gis_score)

#Similar results when only using the three variables in a linear model
```
